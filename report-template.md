## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this analysis is to determine the risk involved in approving loans for customers based on factors such as loan size, interest rate, debt to income ration, number of accounts, and total debt. The analysis uses a Logistic Regression Model to determine the efficacy of a loan based on loan status.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model:
  * Balanced Accuracy Score: 95.21% -- This score is the average of the true positive and true negative cases. It essentially assesses the overall performance of the machine learning model on an imbalanced data set.
  * Precision Score: 99% -- This value is the fraction of true positive outcomes within all positive outcomes, returning the precision of the model.
  * Recall Score: 91% -- This value is the fraction of predicted true positive outcomes versus the actual true outcomes based on the data.

## Summary

* The Logisitic Regression Model performs very well based on the Accuracy, Precision, and Recall Scores. This is likely due to the very large data set and the relevance of the feature data to the desired outcome. I would recommend the mdel for use by the company.
